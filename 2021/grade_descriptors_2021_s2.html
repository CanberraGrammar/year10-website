They are able to develop effective machine learning models, implemented using Python and the AWS technology stack for use on the AWS DeepRacer platform. They have demonstrated an excellent ability to write reward functions which incentivise correct behaviours. Additionally, they have a deep knowledge of available parameters allowing them to fine-tune their reward functions to further enhance performance and optimise their models. They have also mastered the use of hyperparameters, using judgment combined with an iterative approach, for further adjustment and refinement of how the model is trained to maximise performance. The student has an in-depth knowledge of advanced features and capabilities of the AWS DeepRacer platform and is able to implement these to train an effective model.</p></td>
